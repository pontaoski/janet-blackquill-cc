## hi, i'm janet

i love all things human-computer interaction.

i spend most of my time improving [the KDE project](https://kde.org/)'s software, from both a design and development standpoint.

when i'm not doing that, you can see me working on other projects like [developer tooling for QML](https://invent.kde.org/sdk/qml-lsp), a [programming language](https://github.com/tawasprache/kompilierer), an [open federated chat protocol](https://github.com/harmony-development/), a [toki pona publication](https://lipukule.org/), among other things.
